# kofi-btn-react

This is a simple library adding a react component for a Kofi button.

I made it because the existing options didnt seem to work for me.

## Storybook

You can check out the component with story book if you clone the git repo

## Example

Usage is as such:
```
import KofiButton from 'kofi-btn-react'

...

const Test = () => {
    return <KofiButton label='Support Me' user='t2pellet' />
}
```

It supports a `color` prop as well

It looks identical to the `<script>` tag one from Kofi
